# MyTube
MyTube Is Basically A Website Made Using Youtube Data API.
What It Does Is When You Search For A Channel It Will Show The Recent Videos Of That Particular Channel With Their Description.
Instead Of Using Youtube Search API,I Tried To Implement The Search Function Using Youtube Data API.
Along With This I Have Made Another Website For Searching Video Which Is Indeed Based On Youtube Search API.Which Is Available In The Navbar.
 [MyTube-Search](http://aswinzz.tech/MyTube-Search/)

I Havent Developed The Front End Much.It Is A simple Website Made From Scratch.(No Templates Used :))

I Have Added A Download Link For The Video Too.
Another Feature Is That You Can Download Subtitles Of Almost All Videos in youtube.
There is a feature to download the video As MP3 File too.
